# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI Bot (using Minimax algorithm)
## Project Description
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed for Android, using Jetpack Compose for user interface
construction and Kotlin as the main programming language. A unique feature of this project is the
integration of an AI Bot, built based on the Minimax algorithm, creating a formidable opponent for
